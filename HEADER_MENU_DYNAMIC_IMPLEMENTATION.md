# Header Menu Dynamic Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of dynamic header menu functionality including notifications, user profile settings, and logout menu for the SafetyAI application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Notifications System
- **Real-time Notifications**: Integrated with WebSocket context for live updates
- **Notification Types**: Support for alert, system, info, and success notifications
- **Unread Count Badge**: Dynamic badge showing unread notification count
- **Notification Actions**: Mark as read, mark all as read, delete individual notifications
- **Smart Filtering**: Search, type, and read status filtering

### 2. Enhanced User Profile Menu
- **User Information Display**: Shows username, email, and role
- **Profile Navigation**: Quick access to profile, settings, and account security
- **Logout Functionality**: Secure logout with proper state cleanup

### 3. New Dashboard Pages
- **User Profile Page** (`/dashboard/profile`): Edit profile information, view account details
- **Settings Page** (`/dashboard/settings`): Manage account settings, preferences, and security
- **Account Security Page** (`/dashboard/account`): Password management, 2FA, session control
- **Notifications Page** (`/dashboard/notifications`): Comprehensive notification management

### 4. Enhanced Header Functionality
- **Search Bar**: Mock search functionality with results dropdown
- **Click Outside Handling**: Dropdowns close when clicking outside
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly dropdown layouts
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions for better UX

## Files Created/Modified

### New Components

- `frontend/components/dashboard/settings.tsx` - Account settings and preferences
- `frontend/components/dashboard/account-security.tsx` - Security settings and 2FA
- `frontend/components/dashboard/notifications.tsx` - Notification management

### New Hooks
- `frontend/hooks/use-notifications.ts` - Notification state management and WebSocket integration

### New Pages
- `frontend/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx` - Profile route
- `frontend/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` - Settings route
- `frontend/app/dashboard/account/page.tsx` - Account security route
- `frontend/app/dashboard/notifications/page.tsx` - Notifications route

### Modified Files
- `frontend/components/layout/header.tsx` - Enhanced with dynamic notifications and user menu
- `frontend/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` - Added navigation for new pages

## Technical Implementation Details

### Notification System Architecture
```typescript
// WebSocket event subscription
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isConnected) return;

  const unsubscribeNewAlert = subscribe('new_alert', (data) => {
    // Transform WebSocket data to notification format
    const newNotification: Notification = {
      id: `alert-${Date.now()}`,
      type: 'alert',
      title: 'Safety Violation Detected',
      message: `${data.payload.violation_type} detected in ${data.payload.location_id}`,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      isRead: false,
      data: { alertId, severity, location, camera }
    };
    addNotification(newNotification);
  });
}, [subscribe, isConnected]);
```

### State Management
- **Local State**: Component-level state for UI interactions
- **Hook State**: Centralized notification state via `useNotifications`
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time updates from backend events

### User Experience Features
- **Smart Filtering**: Multi-criteria notification filtering
- **Bulk Actions**: Mark all as read, clear all notifications
- **Contextual Navigation**: Click notifications to navigate to relevant pages
- **Visual Feedback**: Unread indicators, type-based colors, timestamps

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Integration
- All new pages require authentication via `useAuth` hook
- User data is safely accessed with fallback values
- Logout properly cleans up all states and redirects

### Data Validation
- Form inputs include proper validation
- Password strength requirements
- Secure session management options

## Responsive Design

### Mobile Optimization
- Collapsible dropdowns for small screens
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Responsive grid layouts for stats and content

### Desktop Enhancement
- Hover effects and transitions
- Multi-column layouts for better information density
- Keyboard navigation support

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data updates
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Date range, severity level, and custom filters
3. **Notification Preferences**: User-configurable notification rules
4. **Export Functionality**: Download notification history
5. **Integration APIs**: Connect with external notification services

### Technical Improvements
1. **Performance**: Implement virtual scrolling for large notification lists
2. **Caching**: Add notification caching for offline support
3. **Analytics**: Track notification engagement and user behavior
4. **Accessibility**: Enhanced screen reader support and keyboard navigation

## Testing and Validation
