# Video Upload Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a video file upload and processing feature that allows users to test alert generation logic using prerecorded videos instead of live camera feeds.

## Problem Statement

The original requirement was:
> "As a Live Monitoring user, I need to verify that my alert rules are working correctly by feeding a prerecorded video into the system instead of a live camera."

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Backend API Endpoints** (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/video.py`)

#### New Endpoints Added:
- **`POST /api/v1/video/upload-video`**: Upload video files with camera association
- **`POST /api/v1/video/process-video/{upload_id}`**: Start processing uploaded videos
- **`GET /api/v1/video/upload-status/{upload_id}`**: Get processing status and results
- **`GET /api/v1/video/uploads`**: List user's video uploads
- **`DELETE /api/v1/video/upload/{upload_id}`**: Delete uploaded videos

#### Key Features:
- File validation (video types only, 100MB limit)
- User authentication and authorization
- Temporary file storage with cleanup
- Background video processing
- Progress tracking and status updates

### 2. **Video Service Enhancement** (`backend/app/services/video_service.py`)

#### New Method:
- **`process_video_file()`**: Processes uploaded video files frame by frame

#### Processing Logic:
- Frame extraction using OpenCV
- AI analysis on each frame (5 FPS for performance)
- Alert generation based on detected violations
- Video timestamp calculation for precise event location
- WebSocket notifications for real-time updates

#### Integration:
- Connects with existing AI engine
- Integrates with alert service
- Uses WebSocket service for notifications
- Maintains processing state and progress

### 3. **Frontend API Layer** (`frontend/lib/api/monitoring.ts`)

#### New Interfaces:
- `VideoUpload`: Complete upload information
- `VideoUploadResponse`: Upload confirmation response
- `VideoProcessingResponse`: Processing status response
- `VideoUploadsList`: Paginated uploads list

#### New API Methods:
- `uploadVideoFile()`: Upload video files
- `processVideoFile()`: Start video processing
- `getUploadStatus()`: Get processing status
- `listUserUploads()`: List user uploads
- `deleteUpload()`: Delete uploads

### 4. **Frontend Component** (`frontend/components/monitoring/video-upload-manager.tsx`)

#### Component Features:
- File selection and validation
- Upload progress tracking
- Processing status monitoring
- Uploads management (view, delete)
- Real-time progress updates
- Integration with camera selection

#### User Experience:
- Intuitive file upload interface
- Clear status indicators
- Progress bars for processing
- Action buttons for each upload
- Responsive design and error handling

### 5. **Integration with Live Monitoring** (`frontend/components/monitoring/live-monitoring.tsx`)

#### Changes Made:
- Added VideoUploadManager component
- Integrated with camera selection
- Added alert generation callback
- Maintained existing functionality

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow:
```
User Upload → Backend Validation → File Storage → Background Processing → AI Analysis → Alert Generation → WebSocket Notification → Frontend Update
```

### Key Components:
1. **File Upload Handler**: Manages file uploads and validation
2. **Video Processor**: Processes video files frame by frame
3. **AI Integration**: Analyzes frames for safety violations
4. **Alert System**: Generates alerts with video metadata
5. **Status Tracking**: Monitors processing progress
6. **Frontend Manager**: Provides user interface and management

### Security Features:
- File type validation
- Size limits (100MB)
- User authentication required
- Access control (users can only access their uploads)
- Temporary storage with cleanup

## Usage Workflow

### 1. **Setup**
- Navigate to Live Monitoring
- Select a camera from the list
- Scroll to Video Upload Testing section

### 2. **Upload**
- Choose video file (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.)
- Add optional description
- Click Upload Video
- Wait for upload completion

### 3. **Processing**
- Click "Process for Alerts"
- Monitor processing progress
- Wait for completion notification

### 4. **Results**
- View generated alerts in Alerts section
- Check video-specific metadata
- Verify alert accuracy and timing

## Benefits

### 1. **Testing and Validation**
- Test alert rules without live cameras
- Validate AI model performance
- Debug detection algorithms
- Train and demonstrate system capabilities

### 2. **Flexibility**
- Use any prerecorded video
- Test specific scenarios
- Repeat tests consistently
- Offline processing capability

### 3. **Development and QA**
- Faster iteration cycles
- Consistent test data
- Performance benchmarking
- Edge case testing

### 4. **User Experience**
- Intuitive interface
- Real-time progress tracking
- Clear status indicators
- Comprehensive management tools

## Performance Considerations

### Processing Speed:
- **Frame Rate**: 5 FPS for optimal performance
- **Memory Usage**: Scales with video resolution
- **Processing Time**: Proportional to video length
- **Resource Management**: Background processing with cleanup

### Optimization Features:
- Frame skipping for performance
- Progress tracking and updates
- Background processing
- Automatic resource cleanup

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems:
- **Camera Management**: Uses existing camera selection
- **Alert System**: Integrates with current alert workflow
- **User Authentication**: Leverages existing auth system
- **WebSocket Service**: Uses current notification system

### New Capabilities:
- **Video Processing**: Frame-by-frame analysis
- **File Management**: Upload, storage, and cleanup
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates
- **Metadata Storage**: Video-specific information

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
- Batch processing for multiple videos
- Scheduled processing during off-peak hours
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Export capabilities for results

### Performance Improvements:
- GPU acceleration for video processing
- Parallel processing for multiple videos
- Smart frame sampling algorithms
- Result caching and reuse

## Testing and Validation

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Basic Upload**: Verify file upload functionality
2. **Processing**: Test video processing pipeline
3. **Alert Generation**: Validate alert creation
4. **Integration**: Test with existing systems
5. **Performance**: Measure processing speed and resource usage

### Quality Assurance:
- File validation and error handling
